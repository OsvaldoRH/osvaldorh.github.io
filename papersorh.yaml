    abstract: In this article, a technique for the reduction of total harmonic distortion (THD) in distributed renewables energy access (DREA) composed of wind turbines is introduced and tested under the wind speed conditions presented in Tamaulipas, Mexico. The analysis and simulation are delimited by a study case based on wind speeds measured and recorded for one year at two highs in the municipality of Soto La Marina, Tamaulipas, Mexico. From this information, the most probable wind speed and the corresponding turbulence intensity is calculated and applied to a wind energy conversion system (WECS). The WECS is composed of an active front-end (AFE) converter topology using four voltage source converters (VSCs) connected in parallel with a different phase shift angle at the digital sinusoidal pulse width modulation (DSPWM) signals of each VSC. The WECS is formed by the connection of five type-4 wind turbines (WTs). The effectiveness and robustness of the DREA integration are reviewed in the light of a complete mathematical model and corroborated by the simulation results in Matlab-Simulink®. The results evidence a reduction of the THD in grid currents up to four times and which enables the delivery of a power capacity of 10 MVA in the Tamaulipas AC distribution grid that complies with grid code of harmonic distortion production.

  abstract: Estimating the power output is one of the elements that determine the
    techno-economic feasibility of a renewable project. At present, there is a need
    to develop reliable methods that achieve this goal, thereby contributing to wind
    power penetration. In this study, we propose a method for wind power error estimation
    based on the wind speed measurement error, probability density function, and wind
    turbine power curves. This method uses the actual wind speed data without prior
    statistical treatment based on 28 wind turbine power curves, which were fitted
    by Lagrange's method, to calculate the estimate wind power output and the corresponding
    error propagation. We found that wind speed percentage errors of 10% were propagated
    into the power output estimates, thereby yielding an error of 5%. The proposed
    error propagation complements the traditional power resource assessments. The
    wind power estimation error also allows us to estimate intervals for the power
    production leveled cost or the investment time return. The implementation of this
    method increases the reliability of techno-economic resource assessment studies.

  abstract: Due the different possibilities for fit the Probability Density Functions
    adjustable to a wind speed data set, a best fit selection criterion is developed
    based on slope, intercept values and standard errors of Ordinary Linear Regression
    model calculated from the probabilistic model and experimental data. Uncertainty
    associated with measuring instruments is analyzed, and an interpretation is presented
    in terms of the electric power generated. In addition, a methodology is proposed
    to generate scenarios of energy production used in financial evaluations, which
    is possible since the wind speed data used retain its uncertainty. The relevant
    conclusions are that a sampling technique based on representative average wind
    speeds does not reproduce the original distribution of wind speed data set, since
    for the observed sample, the parameters of the fitted distributions vary depending
    on sampling time. Accordingly, assessments based on this sample technique leads
    to a resource underestimation.

  abstract: The use of small wind turbines (SWTs) is an alternative energy strategy
    with increasing potential for satisfying in situ electrical demands and should
    be studied to promote social penetration. The Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area
    (VMMA) has air pollution issues that need to be addressed. This has resulted in
    programs for monitoring atmospheric variables, such as wind speed. By selecting
    and using 3 years’ worth of available data, we developed a methodology to study
    the technical and economic feasibility of using SWTs in the VMMA. To this end,
    28 SWT models were assessed at 18 locations to estimate annual energy production.
    In light of certain data characteristics, an adjustment to the power production
    was proposed for the specific case of using SWTs. Cash flow analysis and annualized
    net present value (ANPV) were used to determine economic feasibility for each
    location; furthermore, electric home feeds in the VMMA were considered to model
    local economic conditions. Similar wind conditions were observed within the VMMA;
    however, only two wind turbine and location models provided positive ANPV values.
    The extra annual benefit for each project was calculated by associating the cost
    per mitigation of CO2 emissions, which may provide an economic strategy for promoting
    the penetration of this technology.

  abstract: Wind turbine for low power applications is a clean energy alternative
    to contribute global warming mitigation. The correct description of wind speeds
    is crucial to determine the economic viability of a wind power project. The sampling
    technique used in resource assessment is supported by van der Hoven's work, which
    concludes that minimum dispersion occurs between 0.1 and 2hours mean time. International
    standards for wind turbine power characterization are also based on this work.
    Here we analyze the influence of using different mean times over data dispersion
    and wind resource assessment and analyze an adequate mean time for small wind
    turbine (SWT) applications that contributes to the development of reliable resource
    assessments. We found a maximum dispersion around 1minute mean time. The stable
    wind conditions region was not found in the dispersion analysis presented here.
    Using this time in SWT resource assessment will detect the largest amount of changes
    in the time series that may contribute to power production. Resource assessments
    calculated show that using 1 and 10minutes as mean times generates power resource
    assessments with a difference around 17%, which may be a factor that prevents
    SWT penetration. There exist at least two factors to obtain reliable power resource
    assessment, the SWT selection and ensemble mean time.

  abstract: The accurate assessment of wind turbine output power is crucial in the
    process of sizing wind farms. Typically, this assessment is based on the manufacturer’s
    characteristic power curve, which relates wind speed to power output. However,
    the manufacturer’s power curve is often an idealized representation that may not
    accurately reflect the actual power output of the turbine under real-world conditions.
    To address this limitation, various techniques have been employed to develop more
    precise power curves, including curve fitting, artificial intelligence, probabilistic
    models, and Gaussian processes. This paper introduces a novel method for modeling
    the power curve that takes into account the specific conditions at the wind turbine’s
    location. The method involves transforming wind speed data into a graph that resembles
    the phase space commonly used in statistical mechanics. By applying the k-means
    algorithm to this phase space, clusters of wind speeds can be identified. Furthermore,
    the corresponding clusters of wind turbine output power can be determined based
    on the identified wind speed clusters. These clusters of power data provide valuable
    information for constructing a more accurate power curve using an adjustment function.
    By utilizing this method, the authorss demonstrate a significant improvement in
    the accuracy of power output estimation compared to relying solely on the manufacturer’s
    power curve. The proposed approach considers the unique characteristics of the
    wind speed data and incorporates them into the modeling process, resulting in
    a more reliable representation of the turbine’s power output. This advancement
    represents a significant step forward in optimizing the sizing of wind farms and
    ensuring their efficient operation.

  abstract: In the fundamental stage of resource assessment, high-quality wind speed
    measurements are required to estimate power production. However, this high-quality
    data is not always available, and therefore the analysis of alternative sources
    becomes essential. In this work, we analyze the ability of MERRA-2 to represent
    wind speed characteristics at 24 anemometric stations in Mexico. The assessment
    was carried out using the Pearson correlation coefficient between the observed
    time series, and the obtained by interpolating bias-corrected reanalysis-estimated
    wind speed to all locations for different time-averaging periods. Results showed
    that the reanalysis' performance is not uniform throughout the country; it depends
    on the time resolution, local orographic conditions, and the relationship between
    the local flow and the large-scale circulation. Based on these results, the country
    was subdivided into eight regions. The best-represented region was the Chivela
    Pass, where the winds are tightly linked to the interaction between the large-scale
    circulation and the local orography. The worst performing regions were located
    where the land sea-mask and orography at the reanalysis' resolution may not be
    accurate enough to reproduce the station's wind speeds. Reanalysis-estimated capacity
    factors exhibit large interannual variability in some stations, which can have
    significant consequences for the operation of individual wind farms and the power
    grid. The results show that, while caution should be exercised when applying reanalyses
    to wind resource assessment in Mexico, reanalysis wind power estimates can be
    a valuable tool to investigate the feasibility and installed capacity requirements
    for Mexico to meet its renewable energy targets.

  abstract: Mexico's national electric grid comprises ten regional systems, with one
    isolated in the south of the Baja California Peninsula. In addition, providing
    electricity access remains a challenge in the country. Therefore, distributed
    renewable energy solutions are relevant to satisfy the electricity demand and
    promote grid development. Distributed renewable energy access (DREA) based on
    a wind energy conversion system integrated into low-voltage direct current (LVDC)
    networks is presented. The DREA is analysed and simulated under wind speed conditions
    measured and recorded for one year at Baja California Sur. A representative variability
    is applied to five type-4 wind turbines based on wind speed turbulence intensity
    analysis. The generated power is transferred through a bidirectional dual active
    bridge converter, controlled by a novel small-signal model using a single closed-loop
    proportional-integral control, owing to its modularity, power density, and ability
    to transfer power from LVDC to high-voltage direct current. The effectiveness
    and robustness of the proposed DREA are assessed via a complete mathematical model,
    corroborated by the simulation results in MATLAB-Simulink®, and validated by experimental
    results using the real-time simulator Opal-RT Technologies® and laboratory prototyping.
    The results indicate a DC-link voltage compensation and integration of a power
    capacity of 150 kW in the LVDC networks with an efficiency of 94%.

  abstract: The climate crisis has led to an increased interest in renewable energy,
    and in wind energy in particular. Wind farms with the largest generating potential
    are generally located offshore. In this study we consider the case of Mexico,
    a sub-tropical country in North-America. Due to Mexico's location, offshore wind
    farms (OWF) would be at risk of damage from strong winds associated with tropical
    cyclones (TCs) in both the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico basins. Thus, here we
    ask whether there are any regions in Mexico combining a high generating potential
    and a low risk from tropical cyclones. To answer this question, the ERA5 reanalysis
    has been used to identify two sites on the Pacific coast and two sites in the
    Gulf of Mexico with high wind power potential. Then, using the ERA5 reanalysis
    and TC best-track observational data, the potential effects of four major hurricanes
    and the climatological hazard posed by TC-related damaging winds on OWFs at those
    sites have been investigated. The return period for TCs with near-surface winds
    exceeding 50m s−1, a threshold associated with increased structural damage likelihood,
    has been estimated at as low as 8 years for the Gulf of Mexico and above 64 years
    for Pacific coast. Therefore, in terms of the magnitude of the TC-related hazard,
    the Pacific coast sites are found to be preferred as locations for the development
    of OWFs. These results are relevant for any planning of offshore wind energy in
    Mexico, and the methodology applicable to any other sub-tropical region in which
    the risk of tropical cyclones is present.

  abstract: The characterization of wind speed and its variability at a site is important
    for wind resource assessment. The most readily available wind measurements are
    at 10 m above ground level. These measurements can then be extrapolated vertically
    to estimate wind power production. In this work, the Monin–Obukhov similarity
    method was implemented to estimate the wind speed vertical profile within the
    surface boundary layer for a southeast Mexican site, considering seasonal and
    diurnal variations of the surface boundary layer stability parameters. Additionally,
    a power-law method was implemented where the wind shear exponent was set following
    the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard and using a variable
    wind shear exponent. The results showed that the log-law and the variable wind
    shear method produce better estimates than the IEC standard. The mean power production
    was estimated at hub height (80 m above surface level) using anemometric data
    from the Mexican Wind Atlas and then compared with that calculated using the equivalent
    wind speed estimated from variable wind shear exponent and log-law model. No influence
    of the vertical wind speed variation within and on top (up to 117.5 m) of the
    surface boundary layer was found on the mean power production for a wind turbine
    with a diameter of 90 m and a hub height of 80 m.

  abstract: Based on the Van der Hoven’s seminal work, wind power industry has adopted
    the 10 min mean time as the proper sampling to estimate resource assessment. However,
    research within the literature questions the generalization of the 10 min as a
    standard measure of minima dispersion due to the particular geographic characteristics
    where the measurements took place. In this work is analyzed the power spectrum
    of a high-frequency wind speed time series and its influence over the resource
    assessment in the region of La Ventosa, Oaxaca, Mexico. Power spectrum analysis
    from a monthly, seasonal, and annual time series results show a defined synoptic-scale,
    diurnal, and semi-diurnal variations, which changes in amplitude throughout the
    year. To study the influence of power spectrum in wind resource assessment were
    estimated and compared the capacity factors of a typical 2 MW wind turbine against
    measured wind speed with 1, 5, 10, 60, and 360 min mean times, we found that a
    maximum difference of 1.4 % . Resource assessment was also estimated using reanalysis
    data and WRF results, finding similar to high-resolution estimations, highlighting
    bias-corrected WRF performance, offering reliable results to model power performance
    after a statistical correction.

  abstract: Wind speed turbulence intensity is a crucial parameter in designing the
    structure of wind turbines. The IEC61400 considers the Normal Turbulence Model
    (NTM) as a reference for fatigue load calculations for small and large wind turbines.
    La Ventosa is a relevant region for the development of the wind power sector in
    Mexico. However, in the literature, there are no studies on this important parameter
    in this zone. Therefore, we present an analysis of the turbulence intensity to
    improve the understanding of local winds and contribute to the development of
    reliable technical solutions. In this work, we experimentally estimate the turbulence
    intensity of the region and the wind shear exponent in terms of atmospheric stability
    to analyze the relation of these design parameters with the recommended standard
    for large and small wind turbines. The results showed that the atmosphere is strongly
    convective and stable in most of the eleven months studied. The turbulence intensity
    analysis showed that for a range of wind speeds between 2 and 24 m/s, some values
    of the variable measured were greater than those recommended by the standard,
    which corresponds to 388 hours of turbulence intensity being underestimated. This
    may lead to fatigue loads and cause structural damage to the technologies installed
    in the zone if they were not designed to operate in these wind speed conditions.

  abstract: Understanding near-surface wind variability is crucial to support wind
    power penetration on national electrical grids. High-resolution numerical simulations
    are often proposed as the best solution to study the fluctuation of wind resources.
    We compare Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Modern-Era Retrospective
    Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) bias-corrected wind
    speeds at hub height at different spatial resolutions and transform them to wind
    power production using a logistic power curve fitted to wind power measurements;
    the comparisons are based on error statistics and time series spectral analysis.
    The results show that numerical models reproduce observed wind speeds with correlations
    higher than 0.9 for WRF and 0.8 for MERRA-2. Moreover, annual observed wind power
    is reproduced with a maximum difference from observations of 0.011. However, each
    resolution reproduces the magnitudes of high-resolution periodicities differently
    so that there is a clear relationship between grid size and signal variance at
    high frequencies, as variance is indirectly proportional to frequency. This relationship
    is expected for wind speed, but based on results, it can be associated also for
    capacity factor sampled at hopublished_urly intervals. Therefore, the main benefit of high
    spatial resolution lies in the added variance in frequencies at sub-daily time
    scales. The study of the added value of high-resolution simulations in this region
    contributes to current efforts to develop reliable forecasting tools and strategies
    to support the development of wind power as a reliable energy source.

  abstract: Given the increasing integration of wind-based generation systems into
    the electric grid, efforts have been made to deal with the problem of power quality
    associated with the intermittent nature of these systems. This paper presents
    a new modelling approach oriented towards harmonic distortion analysis of the
    induction machine for wind power applications. The model is developed using companion
    harmonic circuit modelling, which is a natural approach for analysis of the adverse
    effects of harmonic distortion in electric power systems, and represents an easier
    solution method than the well known dynamic harmonic domain, since it solves algebraic
    equations instead of state-space differential equations. The structure of the
    companion circuits simplifies both the formulation and solution for power systems
    with wind-based generation systems. This approach is especially useful for analysis
    of the harmonic interaction in transient and steady states between the wind power
    generator and the power system, whose interconnection is made through electronic
    converters. The proposed model allows us to compute the dynamics of the wind turbine,
    which are influenced by disturbances such as changes in the wind velocity, voltage
    fluctuations, electric waveform distortion, and mechanical vibrations, among other
    factors. Moreover, the cross-coupling between harmonic components at different
    frequencies is considered. The proposed model represents an integral framework
    of the electrical and mechanical subsystems of a wind turbine, allowing for analysis
    of the interactions between them, and understanding power quality degradation
    behaviour as well as causes and consequences, while also giving useful information
    on the field of simulation and control. To test the performance of the proposed
    model, a test power system is used to obtain the behaviour of a wind turbine induction
    generator in response to typical power quality disturbances, i.e., harmonic distortion,
    and voltage sags and swells. Then, the dynamics of the variables considering their
    harmonic interactions are analysed.

  abstract: 'Mexico is an attractive candidate for offshore wind energy development
    due to its geographical location with extensive coasts in the Pacific Ocean and
    Mexico''s Gulf. Although potential offshore wind areas have been geographically
    assessed, an evaluation of the seasonal variations of the capacity factors has
    not been considered for the feasibility of the locations. This research identifies
    potential zones for offshore wind development in the Gulf of Mexico, implementing
    geographical restrictions such as the Economic Exclusive Zone, distance from the
    coast, protected areas, bathymetry, and capacity factor seasonality. Wind speeds
    were obtained from 39 years of reanalyses historical data and two reference wind
    turbines of 5 and 10 MW were included in the analysis. Three potential areas were
    identified from the results: the northeast Tamaulipas, the western Campeche, and
    the northern Yucatan. Monthly mean capacity factors above 45% were estimated from
    October to June, with the maximum values near 60% between March and April. Conversely,
    minimum values were observed from July to September but consistently higher than
    30%. The analyzed zones show suitable technical conditions for offshore wind development.
    Further analysis is needed to validate the wind speed conditions, in addition
    to the evaluation of economic factors, the study of extreme weather conditions
    like tropical cyclones as well as characteristics in the intertropical region.'
